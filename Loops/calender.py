# I used the for loop to print every day of the month of february.
# I used the variable number to save the number of days in the month and i started it in the range of 1-32
# 1 because it starts from the first value and 32 because the loops ends in the last but one value
# so it will stop at 31.
# lastly i just used a print statement, converted the number to a string and concatenated it with
# the string January and the output is perfect.

for number in range(1,32):
    print('January ' + str(number))
